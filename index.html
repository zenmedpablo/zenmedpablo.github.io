  	<h2>Pablo Zendejas Medina</h2>
  	<p>Hi there! I'm a philosopher at New York University, where I'm currently a Bersoff Faculty Fellow. Before that, I did my PhD at the University of Pittsburgh. My research is mostly in epistemology and decision theory, but really I'm interested in anything to do with reasons and rationality.</p>
	<p>My work explores what rationality requires of agents who are limited or &#8220;non-ideal&#8220;, for example in not being able to use all of their beliefs at every step in reasoning, or in not being able to tell what their evidence is.
I also have research on other topics, such as the relationship between ethics and decision theory, the value of inquiry, the revision of qualitative (&#8220;full&#8220;) beliefs, and the justification of Bayesian updating.</p>
    <p>You can contact me at zendejas.pablo [at] gmail.com.</p>

		<p>Consequentialism and Deontological Prohibitions [<a class="abstract_toggle">abstract</a>] Forthcoming. <i>The Philosophical Quarterly</i>.</p>

		<div class="abstract">It is widely held that Consequentialism, in its traditional, agent-neutral form, is inconsistent with deontological prohibitions, such as those on killing or breaking promises.
However, the standard argument for this claim is incomplete, which has led some to make the surprising claim that Consequentialism and Deontology can be reconciled.
I argue for the orthodox view, by showing that there are possible situations, deontological judgments about which cannot be incorporated into a consequentialist moral theory (``consequentialised''), on pain of generating axiological cycles.
As my argument shows, the orthodox view is also right about the reason for the incompatibility: Consequentialism, being agent-neutral, gives everyone the same moral goal, whereas deontological prohibitions, being agent-relative, give everyone different goals.

		<div class="abstract">Two of the most influential arguments for Bayesian updating (&#8220;Conditionalization&#8221;) --- Hilary Greaves' and David Wallace's <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/GREJCC"><i>Accuracy Argument</i></a> and David Lewis' <a href="https://andrewmbailey.com/dkl/Why_Conditionalize.pdf"><i>Diachronic Dutch Book Argument</i></a> --- seem to impose a strong and surprising limitation on rational uncertainty: that one can never be rationally uncertain of what one's evidence is. Many philosophers (&#8220;externalists&#8221;) reject that claim, and now seem to face a difficult choice: either to endorse the arguments and give up Externalism, or to reject the arguments and lose some of the best justifications of Conditionalization. The author argues that the key to resolving this conflict lies in recognizing that both arguments are <i>plan-based</i>, in that they argue for Conditionalization by first arguing that one should <i>plan</i> to conditionalize. With this in view, it is argued that the conflict with Externalism only arises if one misconceives the requirement to carry out a plan made at an earlier time. They should therefore not persuade us to reject Externalism. Furthermore, rethinking the nature of this requirement allows us to give two new arguments for Conditionalization that don't rule out rational uncertainty about one's evidence and that can thus serve as common ground in the debate between externalists and their opponents.</div>
